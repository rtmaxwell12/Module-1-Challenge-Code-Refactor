# Code Refactor Starter Code

## Description
We have been contracted by Horiseon to refactor the code of their client-facing website to meet and follow accessibility standards with the end goal of greater search engine optimization. This includes deleting redundant code, adding alt text for screen readers, adding semantic HTML elements, and adding a clear title. The code will be presented in a clean, organized fashion for easy future amendments.

## Installation

Installation not necessary. Changes have been deployed to live website.

## Features

This file has been updated to include semantic HMTL elements, therefore the following tags have been implemented:
- header
- nav
- main
- aside
- section
- img

These tags were added in a logical structure for efficient future revisions. 

All CSS classes and selectors have been updated accordingly to ensure styling integrity of the page.

Alt attribute descritptions were added to each image to meet accessibility standards.
